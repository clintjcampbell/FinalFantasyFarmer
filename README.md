 This python scrip uses python 3.5 and requires bluestacks to be installed and open with your session open. The script looks for all windows called Blue Stacks and manipulates the mouse in order to click on the different options.  
 
 install the different pip installation dependencies. 
 Open a command window after python is installed.  Enter your enviroment if you have a special one set up. (possibly run as adminstrator)
 type "pip install 'name of installation'" in command window and hit enter.  Do this for each dependency that isn't available automatically.
 You will need to install OpenCV (CV2 for python 3.5) I believe there is a pip install for this if you look hard enough
 you will also need to install win32gui and win32api
 
 
 this script may require some editing to make it work for your account as I use screen shots to compare what to find on the screen.  For example sending resources when your main account is in the farm guild needs to take a screen capture of your user name on the resource help page.  Replace mine with yours and it should work. 
 
 Message me if you are having issues with it FFF+
